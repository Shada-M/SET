          <p>Use your mouse to select SETs from the board. 
          
           A set consists of three cards satisfying all of these conditions: 
          <ul>
                <li>They all have the same number or have three different numbers.</li>
                <li> They all have the same symbol or have three different symbols.</li>
                <li> They all have the same shading or have three different shadings.</li> 
                <li>  They all have the same color or have three different colors.</li>
          </ul>
           The rules of Set are summarized by: If you can sort a group of three cards into "two of ____ and one of ____", then it is not a set.
